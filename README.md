# Locatizor

Add location data to photos

Great green globs of greasy grimy gopher guts

## Why?

I have an older DSLR that does not include any GPS location data on the photos it takes. Locatizor allows me to add location data to my photos after they've been exported to JPG, so then when I upload them into my iPhoto library, my DSLR photos will show up on the interactive map.
